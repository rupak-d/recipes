## Method

### Step 1

1. Sanitize evrything that will be used in this.
2. Make a brine solution.
3. Weigh and add fermentation chillies & vegetables & fruits to the jar.
4. Note down the weights of each ingredient for future reference.
5. Add brine solution to the jar.
6. Add weight to the top so that everything is covered by the brine.
7. Put the lid on & keep the jar in a dark place for atleast 2 wekks, checking every few days to see if the gas from the fermentation process needs to be released. Also check for yeast/mold.
8. Get ready for step 2 when you are happy with the fermentation.

### Step 2

1. Strain juice.
2. Check brine pH. Should be below 4.5.
3. Blend fermented solids, adding brine as necessary. Add a splash of vinegar.
4. Put 1 tsp xantham gum and blend again.
5. Strain into a pan if you want it less chunky.
6. Heat on low heat ~145F for 15-20 minutes to stop fermentation process.
7. Pour into bottles using a funnel.

## Discussion

1. To add a smoky flavor to the sauces, grill *some* of the ingredients before adding them to the fermentation jar.
2. Label the jars and keep notes of the ingredients used and their amounts.
3. Use small ziploc bags with water if you do not have fermentation weights.
4. Add onions to the top to weigh them down as well.
5. Jar might be cloudy, doesn't mean that it is mold.
6. Try different types of vinegar for different tastes.
7. Can keep it bottled in the fridge for atleast a couple of months.
